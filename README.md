# Plastic-Waste-Profiling
As per the current scenario, the severe issue of plastic garbage management persist. Although there have been bans imposed in some states, but the number of daily plastic garbage generated hasnâ€™t fallen. Per year India produces over 25000 tonnes of plastic waste. 
Project helps to generate statistics regarding every product (that uses plastic material) plastic wastage and trace that back to the manufacturer.
